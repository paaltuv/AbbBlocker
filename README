This is a simple user script for browsers that removes articles about Anders Behring Breivik from the frontpage of norwegian online news papers.
The sites are still not "ABB-free", but there should be minimal exposure to ABB on the supported sites.

Contributors are welcome, the repository for the project is open for editing.
